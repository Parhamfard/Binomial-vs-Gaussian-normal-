Compare the binomial distribution with a Gaussian (normal) distribution, this will bw achieve by the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, regardless of their original distribution, will be approximately normally distributed.

Visualize both the binomial distribution and the Gaussian distribution using Python and Matplotlib:
